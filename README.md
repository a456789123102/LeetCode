# LeetCode Challenges

This repository is dedicated to storing my solutions for various **LeetCode challenges**. It serves as a personal archive for learning and improving problem-solving skills, especially in algorithms and data structures.

## Purpose
- To track and showcase my progress on **LeetCode**.
- To enhance my knowledge in algorithms and data structures.
- To prepare for technical interviews by practicing a wide range of problems.

## What's the Difference Between LeetCode and Codewars?

Both platforms offer great opportunities for practicing programming, but they have different focuses:

- **LeetCode**:
  - Geared towards **interview preparation** for technical roles.
  - Challenges often focus on **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **system design**.
  - Problems are structured by **difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, Hard) and include **company-specific** problems.
  - Offers features like **mock interviews**, **contest participation**, and **premium content**.

- **Codewars**:
  - Focuses more on **language mastery** and **creative problem-solving**.
  - Challenges are called **Katas** and are often shorter and more focused on learning specific language features or patterns.
  - Encourages contributions from the community to create and share new problems.
  - Less emphasis on interview-style questions compared to LeetCode.
